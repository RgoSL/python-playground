# 🧪 Optimistic Code
The goal of this branch is to store a test of how to optimize code functions using process control, aka threads 🧠.

---

### 📌 What does this project do?

> There are two scripts, the "Test" is intended to be more straightforward and less optimized for some computers. While the "TestThreads" applies process control to this same code in order to optimize how it executes its mission.

> In short, apply Threads to make things faster 🏍️.
