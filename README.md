# 🦴 Syntax Practice
The goal of this activity is to practice basic Python concepts. I did some exercises to reinforce a review I did on variables, loops, and conditionals. 😊

### 📌 What's in these codes?

> In the "Syntax.py" code, I made some comments on the most important points of my review, noting only what I found most interesting and curious.

> In the "BasicConcepts.py" code, I created 3 exercises to reinforce the basic concepts studied. The code includes the problem statements and my answers.
  
> In the "DataStructure.py" code, I've already included 3 exercises to reinforce the concept of Data Structures. The code contains the problem statements and my answers.
